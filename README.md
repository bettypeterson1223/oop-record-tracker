# ECS 36B Homework #3: Tracking Objects with OOP
This project, completed as part of ECS 36B (Object-Oriented Programming) at UC Davis, involved designing and implementing a system of classes and objects to model the movement of people, things, and events in a real-world scenario. The assignment required the application of OOP principles to create a robust and extensible solution.

## Project Overview
The task revolved around tracking the movements of an instructor, a student, and various objects (e.g., a bus, a device, a computer) during a trip on Unitrans in Davis, CA. The challenge was to model this scenario using OOP concepts, including classes, inheritance, and JSON serialization.

# Features:
## Class Design:
Created classes like Person, Thing, GPS, Time, and Record.
Implemented attributes and methods to represent and track people, locations, and events.
JSON Serialization:
Implemented dump2JSON member functions to serialize objects into JSON format for records.
Event Logging:
Recorded and serialized key events:
Class started at 6:00 pm in Everson Hall.
Departure from Silo Station at 6:10 pm.
Stop at 8th and J Street at 6:20 pm.
Arrival at Moore and Pollock at 6:32 pm.
